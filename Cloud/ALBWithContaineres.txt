PROBLEM: When I have two targets in my target group.  Both targets are on the same ec2 instance, 
and in containers using different ports.  When I try and open my nginx web server through browser
I get a white screen and error.

- On request I am getting status 200, but all I see is a white screen. 
- When I have 1 target in my target group, either or, I have no issues
- If I go to each port from using the Elastic IP, both ports work
- Target groups shows both targets healthy

error: main.7cce6711.js:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'

I have tried:

clearing browser cache
checking container logs seems ok.
set up logging with the ALB and that seems ok too.  
removing ssl cert to see if it is causing problem
